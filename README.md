# Sanjay Subramaniam Resume

LaTeX code for July 2021 version of resume.

## Motivation

Intention behind this repo is to version control my resume and maintain different branches of it. Since I'm using LaTeX anyways, I figured it would just make more sense to maintain this here rather than to maintain multiple PDF versions.

I tend to use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), a collaborative cloud-based LaTeX editor, for my purposes.

Largely inspired by [@sb2nov's resume](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume) repository.
